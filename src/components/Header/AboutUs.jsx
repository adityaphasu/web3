          The idea for this came from a common frustration: finding a{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold text-slate-50">
            reliable, up-to-date resource for ACTIVE and UPCOMING grant opportunities.
          </span>
          Many existing databases are static, created once and forgotten. We wanted to change that
          by ensuring this database stays relevant and genuinely useful for Web3 projects seeking
          funding.

          This is just version 1 of what we are buildingâ€”simple yet functional. We wanted to share
          it with the community as{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold text-slate-50">
            we continue to work on a more advanced and polished version that will include additional
            features and improvements!
